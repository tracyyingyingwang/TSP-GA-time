# TSP-GA-time
Travelling salesman problem solution using genetic algorithm with time as optimized value instead of distance

Task was to find minimize amount of time needed to visit capitals of European Union member countries assuming that:
- everywhere, except for Poland, velocity of salesman is 70 km/h
- in Poland, velocity is changing in a rectangular function like fashion in range from 50 to 80 km/h

and compare results of haploidal and diploidal algorithm
